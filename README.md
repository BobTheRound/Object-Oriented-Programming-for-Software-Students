# Object-Oriented-Programming-for-Software-Students
Hello reader! My name is Robert Beauchamp, I am a student of Southwest Technical College's Software 
Development program. This repository exists to house files for the next section I will be working on:
"Object Oriented Programing". This is a crucial step for java development and just so happens to be 
the next step on the long road of programming and earning a better career than a factory laborer.
-Live long and prosper.
